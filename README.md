# CCNA-Notes---jdepew88
These are all my of notes from David Bombal's CCNA Start course.

Some of the formatting could be better, but this should be a good resource for ya'll. 

already took the CCNA and passed first try.

I hope the notes help.  If you find any errors in the notes, post an issue and I'll update the erroneous part.
